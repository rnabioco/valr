[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rnabioco/valr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rnabioco/valr) [![AppVeyor Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/rnabioco/valr?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jayhesselberth/valr) [![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/rnabioco/valr/master.svg)](https://codecov.io/github/rnabioco/valr?branch=master) [![](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/valr)](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=valr) [![](http://cranlogs.r-pkg.org/badges/valr?color=FFD700)](http://www.r-pkg.org/pkg/valr) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/49370633.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/49370633)

**`valr` provides tools to read and manipulate genome intervals and signals**, similar to the [`BEDtools`](http://bedtools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) suite. `valr` enables analysis in the R/RStudio environment, leveraging modern R tools in the [`tidyverse`](http://tidyverse.org) for a terse, expressive syntax. Compute-intensive algorithms are implemented in [`Rcpp`](http://www.rcpp.org/)/C++, and many methods take advantage of the speed and grouping capability provided by [`dplyr`](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr).

Installation
------------

The latest stable version can be installed from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages('valr')
```

The latest development version can be installed from github:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github('rnabioco/valr')
```

Why `valr`?
-----------

**Why another tool set for interval manipulations?** Based on our experience teaching genome analysis, we were motivated to develop interval arithmetic software that faciliates genome analysis in a single environment (RStudio), eliminating the need to master both command-line and exploratory analysis tools.

**Note:** `valr` can currently be used for analysis of pre-processed data in BED and related formats. We plan to support BAM and VCF files soon via tabix indexes.

### Familiar tools, natively in R

The functions in `valr` have similar names to their `BEDtools` counterparts, and so will be familiar to users coming from the `BEDtools` suite. Unlike other tools that wrap `BEDtools` and write temporary files to disk, `valr` tools run natively in memory. Similar to [`pybedtools`](https://daler.github.io/pybedtools/#why-pybedtools), `valr` has a terse syntax:

``` r
library(valr)
library(dplyr)

snps <- read_bed(valr_example('hg19.snps147.chr22.bed.gz'), n_fields = 6)
genes <- read_bed(valr_example('genes.hg19.chr22.bed.gz'), n_fields = 6)

# find snps in intergenic regions
intergenic <- bed_subtract(snps, genes)
# find distance from intergenic snps to nearest gene
nearby <- bed_closest(intergenic, genes)

nearby %>%
  select(starts_with('name'), .overlap, .dist) %>%
  filter(abs(.dist) < 5000)
#> # A tibble: 1,047 x 4
#>         name.x   name.y .overlap .dist
#>          <chr>    <chr>    <int> <int>
#>  1 rs530458610    P704P        0  2578
#>  2   rs2261631    P704P        0  -267
#>  3 rs570770556    POTEH        0  -912
#>  4 rs538163832    POTEH        0  -952
#>  5 rs190224195    POTEH        0 -1398
#>  6   rs2379966 DQ571479        0  4749
#>  7 rs142687051 DQ571479        0  3557
#>  8 rs528403095 DQ571479        0  3308
#>  9 rs555126291 DQ571479        0  2744
#> 10   rs5747567 DQ571479        0 -1777
#> # ... with 1,037 more rows
```

### Visual documentation

`valr` includes helpful glyphs to illustrate the results of specific operations, similar to those found in the `BEDtools` documentation. For example, `bed_glyph()` illustrates the result of intersecting `x` and `y` intervals with `bed_intersect()`:

``` r
library(valr)

x <- trbl_interval(
  ~chrom, ~start, ~end,
  'chr1', 25,     50,
  'chr1', 100,    125
)

y <- trbl_interval(
  ~chrom, ~start, ~end,
  'chr1', 30,     75
)

bed_glyph(bed_intersect(x, y))
```

### Reproducible reports

`valr` can be used in RMarkdown documents to generate reproducible work-flows for data processing. Because computations in `valr` are fast, it can be for exploratory analysis with `RMarkdown`, and for interactive analysis using `shiny`.

### Remote databases

Remote databases can be accessed with `db_ucsc()` (to access the UCSC Browser) and `db_ensembl()` (to access Ensembl databases).

``` r
# access the `refGene` tbl on the `hg38` assembly
ucsc <- db_ucsc('hg38')
tbl(ucsc, 'refGene')
```

API
---

Function names are similar to their their [BEDtools](http://bedtools.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) counterparts, with some additions.

### Data types

-   Create interval sets with `tbl_interval()` and `tbl_genome()`, which enforce strict column naming.

-   Generate intervals not covered by a query with `bed_complement()`.
