`valr` enables analysis of genome-scale data sets **within R**, enabling fast, explorative analysis of genome-scale data. Key parts are implemented in `Rcpp` for speed. Moreover, `valr` makes use of new R libraries like `dplyr` and the `magrittr` pipe operator (`%>%`) for an expressive syntax that makes genome analysis fun.

See the [`valr` demo](http://jayhesselberth.github.io/valr-demo) for documentation and examples.

## Installation

`valr` can be installed from github:

```R
devtools::install_github('jayhesselberth/valr')
```
 
Note that `valr` requires a C++11 compiler (gcc>=6.0 or clang++)

## API

Function names are similar to their their [BEDtools][bedtools] counterparts, with some additions.

### Reading data

* BED and related files are read with `read_bed()`, `read_bed12()`, `read_bedgraph()`, `read_narrowpeak()` and `read_broadpeak()`.
  
* Genome files containing chromosome name and size information are loaded with `read_genome()`.
  
* VCF files are loaded with `read_vcf()`.

### Transforming single interval sets

* Intervals are ordered with `bed_sort()`.

* Interval coordinates are adjusted with `bed_slop()` and `bed_shift()`, and new flanking intervals are created with `bed_flank()`.

* Nearby intervals are combined with `bed_merge()` and combined (but not merged) with `bed_cluster()`.  

* The intervals in a genome that are not covered by a query are identified with `bed_complement()`.

### Comparing multiple interval sets

* Find overlaps between two sets of intervals with `bed_intersect()`.

* Apply functions to selected columns for overlapping intervals with `bed_map()`.

* Remove intervals based on overlaps between two files with `bed_subtract()`.

* Find overlapping intervals within a window with `bed_window()`.

* Find the closest intervals independent of overlaps with `bed_closest()`.

### Randomizing intervals

* Generate random intervals from an input genome with `bed_random()`.

* Shuffle the coordinates of input intervals with `bed_shuffle()`.

* Random sampling of input intervals is done with the `sample` function family in `dplyr`.

### Interval statistics

* Measure overlap significance of two sets of intervals with `bed_fisher()`.

* Quantify relative and absolute distances between sets of intervals with `bed_reldist()` and `bed_absdist()`.

* Quantify extent of overlap between two sets of intervals with `bed_jaccard()`.

## Related work

* Command-line tools [BEDtools][1] and [bedops][5].

* The Python library [pybedtools][4] wraps BEDtools.

* The R packages [GenomicRanges][6], [bedr][7] and [IRanges][8] provide similar capability.
